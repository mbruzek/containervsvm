# Containers vs. VMs

A collection of scripts to manage a large number of very basic LXC containers
and VMs for testing or comparison.

## LXC?

Yeah, yeah we all know and use Docker containers, but some times you need a
init system. This is using the old LXC commands, because LXD does not exist
in Debian repositories (and we can't all use Ubuntu). The commands are pretty
limited in this version of LXC but was able to figure out a few things out that
were not well covered elsewhere.

### Too many open files

Creating a large number of containers can make the host Linux system to run out
of inotify instances and watches. The signature of this problem is the script
no longer making progress, this is because the container's systemd is reporting
degrated state and the script can not complete.

To verify this problem attempt to start the container in the foreground and
observe the problem text:  

```
sudo lxc-start -F -n lxc168
...
Failed to create control group inotify object: Too many open files
Failed to allocate manager object: Too many open files
...
```

To see the specific watches and instance kernel limits print the contents of the
runtime files:  

```
cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
65536
cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances
1024
```

To increase the inotify instances and watchers by appending values to the kernel
parameter file `/etc/sysctl.conf` file and reload the configuration file.

```
echo fs.inotify.max_users_watches = 98304 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo fs.inotify.max_users_instances = 1536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

## Virtual Machines

The libguestfs tools are awesome can be used to build and install a KVM virtual
machine very quickly. I spent some time learning how to use the commands
correctly, so wanted to commit the information to a repository for reference in
the future.

The idea is to get a comparison between system containers and VMs without the
marketing bull.
